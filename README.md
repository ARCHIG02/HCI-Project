# NotifyEd - HCI Project README

## Project Overview

Welcome to the README for the NotifyEd project! NotifyEd is an educational technology (EdTech) application designed to address the common issue of information overload caused by excessive smartphone notifications. This document will provide you with an insight into our project's domain, inspiration, idea, problem statement, and solution statement.

## Domain

Our project explores the domain of technology, with a specific focus on EdTech and its immersive experiences. We aim to harness technology to enhance the educational and informational experiences of users.

## Inspiration

Our project was inspired by a common problem faced by many people, including the project team. Excessive notifications on smartphones often lead to important information being ignored or missed. We saw this as a widespread issue and a potential opportunity to make a positive impact. The motivation for our project came from the desire to solve a problem that we personally faced.

## Idea

Our idea is to design an application that can effectively summarize all the notifications a user receives in a day and highlight the most crucial information. The goal is to help users stay informed about their daily tasks without being overwhelmed by constant notifications.

## Problem Statement

Every smartphone user is inundated with notifications throughout the day. This constant stream of information can disrupt a user's concentration and make it challenging to focus on tasks. This trade-off between attention to tasks and notifications often results in users missing important information.

## Solution Statement

NotifyEd is our solution to this problem. It's an EdTech application that offers users an interface to summarize all the notifications they've received in a day, with a focus on highlighting critical information. By providing a summary of notifications, NotifyEd allows users to remain up-to-date without sacrificing their concentration on important tasks.

## Example Use Case

Consider a student attending a lecture or working on an assignment who receives a notification containing vital information. Without NotifyEd, the student would have to choose between breaking their concentration and ignoring the notification, potentially leading to adverse consequences. With NotifyEd, the application provides a summary of notifications later in the day, ensuring the user doesn't miss important information.

## Project Development

We have created a low-fidelity prototype and a higher-fidelity prototype to showcase the design and functionality of NotifyEd. These prototypes demonstrate our vision for the application and its potential to alleviate the notification overload problem.
